# Artstagram
SEI 5/9 Project 2: Artstagram </br>
The idea of this project is to create a platform for artists to upload and promote their work within the art community.

# User Story
The user story to this app is for a user to be able to log in, or create a profile with the fields, first name, last name, email, username, and then password. Once these fields are created, a user should be a ble to login to their account by entering their username and password. Once logged in, the user should be able to upload their own artwork to their page. They should add the image, title, description, and tools used. They can add, edit, or delete art on their own pages. However, there should be multiple users and a user cannot add, edit, or delete artwork on another user's profile. A user can, however, leave comments on other user's artwork they can edit, add, or delete their own comments.

This image explains my so far thought process with the idea. Shows what collections I might have (still a working progress and open for suggestions), what one can do on their profile, and what my art schema would consist of.

This image shows what the index page would look like and then what the user page would look like.
